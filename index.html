                            &laquo;Hello. My&nbsp;name is&nbsp;John Rim. I&nbsp;was born in&nbsp;New York City
                            90&nbsp;years
                            ago. Since the year 2000 reside
                            in&nbsp;Estonia.
                            <br><br>
                            Both my&nbsp;parents and mother&rsquo;s parents were German immigrants to&nbsp;the United
                            States.
                            We&nbsp;respect
                            honest, hardworking
                            foreigners, but we&nbsp;also believe the government has an&nbsp;obligation
                            to&nbsp;citizens,
                            to&nbsp;control
                            immigration, as&nbsp;the American
                            people want. Not a&nbsp;wall like the Berlin Wall but a&nbsp;firm hand&nbsp;&mdash; with
                            border
                            patrollers, police
                            officers, and military
                            police&nbsp;&mdash; plus the necessary equipment and supplies.
                            <br><br>
                            There are neither public nor private schools, teaching military logistics
                            as&nbsp;a&nbsp;career
                            for
                            young
                            people,
                            not in&nbsp;the
                            United States or&nbsp;Europe. Russia has Suvorov Academies and Nakhimov Academies, but
                            no&nbsp;institutions
                            specializing in
                            military logistics.

                            So&nbsp;we&nbsp;have identified a&nbsp;need. An&nbsp;unsatisfied need for military

                            academies, to&nbsp;support

                        The N-PLAN is&nbsp;a&nbsp;distance-learning network of&nbsp;academies in&nbsp;Europe and North

                        2024
                        to&nbsp;2099.
                        <br><br> The N-PLAN was proposed by&nbsp;Rainbow Foundation in&nbsp;2008 by&nbsp;Malle Koppel,
                        later
                        replaced by&nbsp;me,
                        John Rim, and the supervisory board, which consists of&nbsp;Sergei Popov, Bruno Suvi and Olga
                        Popova.
                        N-PLAN
                        has committees in&nbsp;the vicinity
                        of&nbsp;Fort Bragg and Pope Army Air Field, Joint Base Charleston and Kingsley Field.
                        <br><br> Rainbow Foundation has been filing an&nbsp;annual report of&nbsp;activity with the

                        Malle Koppel recruited student volunteers to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;a&nbsp;five-day exhibit
                        in&nbsp;Tallinn, where about
                        30&nbsp;specialized schools, described themselves to&nbsp;younger students, accompanied
                        by&nbsp;their
                        teachers. The
                        Rainbow exhibits featured practical uses of&nbsp;the
                        English language in&nbsp;Estonia, including the use of&nbsp;English by&nbsp;the military
                        in&nbsp;contact with NATO. English
                        is&nbsp;an&nbsp;official NATO language.
                        <br><br> John Rim recruited students for a&nbsp;summer program of&nbsp;games and sports
                        at&nbsp;a&nbsp;small Hiiumaa island
                        in&nbsp;2002. An&nbsp;experiment to&nbsp;learn whether students would speak English, given the
                        opportunity. Four
                        weekly sessions attracted about 60
                        students. The 2002 experiment result was clearly negative&nbsp;&mdash; with no&nbsp;career
                        link,
                        students remained
                        uninterested in&nbsp;the English language outside the context of&nbsp;a&nbsp;school.

                        In&nbsp;2020, N-PLAN focuses on&nbsp;a&nbsp;handful of&nbsp;leaders
                        in&nbsp;30&nbsp;member-states
                        associated with NATO&nbsp;&mdash; and a&nbsp;few
                        more aspiring young leaders such as&nbsp;Anna Jagonen, who was candidate Number 157
                        in&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent election for
                        public office in&nbsp;Estonia.
                        <br><br> The focus is&nbsp;on&nbsp;six positions in&nbsp;each of&nbsp;the 30&nbsp;NATO
                        member-states:
                        Minister of&nbsp;Education,
                        Minister of&nbsp;Defense, Minister of&nbsp;Finance, Minister of&nbsp;Agriculture, Minister
                        of&nbsp;Foreign Contacts and
                        Prime Minister.
                        <br><br> By&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2020, contacts will be&nbsp;made with approximately 180
                        persons
                        in&nbsp;governments.
                        There could have also been conversations among the six persons in&nbsp;each of&nbsp;these NATO
                        member-states.
                        <br><br> By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;2021, a&nbsp;joint conversation will take place among three
                        member-states such as
                        Denmark, Norway and Estonia or&nbsp;Croatia, Italy and Slovenia or&nbsp;Canada, Iceland and
                        USA.
                        This
                        next step
                        could be&nbsp;labeled TROIKA: three pulling
                        in&nbsp;the same direction, as&nbsp;three horses hitched to&nbsp;one sleigh. Later, by&nbsp;the
                        middle
                        of&nbsp;2023, the
                        conversation among groups of&nbsp;six. Next, a&nbsp;conversation of&nbsp;all with NATO
                        headquarters
                        and
                        a&nbsp;commitment
                        from Deutschland to&nbsp;pay the cost of&nbsp;distance-learning
                        from 2024 to&nbsp;2099, which is&nbsp;about 75&nbsp;years or&nbsp;three generations. For more
